This README documents the deployment of Heroku, "The Buzz" UI/how to use it, and the APIs.

### Documentation of Deploying Heroku ###
Heroku allows our team to launch our app on the Heroku server where the web interface is hosted by Heroku and the Android app can reach it.

1. Install the Heroku ClI and create an account.
2. In the Heroku dashboard, I created our app and named it "the-buzz-group25".
